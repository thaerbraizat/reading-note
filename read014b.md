# Project Aristotle’s researchers 

* No matter how researchers arranged the data, though,
it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. 
* Project Aristotle’s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, 
looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an ‘‘unwritten rule’’ or when they explained certain things as part of the ‘‘team’s culture.’’ Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group’s sedate norms,
 and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.
* We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter
* As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined
