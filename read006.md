## WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
variables and functions take on new names. 
you access the properties or methods of an object uding dot notation
you can alsa access properties using square brackets .

The **Document Object Model** (DOM) specifies 
how browsers should create a model of an HTML 
page and how JavaScript can access and update the 
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
## caching dom queries 
methods that find elements in the dom tree are called dom queries
when you need to work with an element more than once you should
use a variable to store the result of this query
getElementByld.

Selects an individual element given the value of its i d attribute . 
The HTML must have an id attribute in order for it to be selectable. 
querySelector

* Uses CSS selector syntax that would select one or more elements . 
This method returns only the first of the matching elements. 
getElementsByClassName 
* Selects one or more elements given the value of their class attribute. 
The HTML must have a class attribute for it to be selectable. 
This method is faster than querySe1ectorA11 () . getElementsByTagName( 1tagName 1) 
Selects all elements on the page with the specified tag name. 
This method is faster than querySelectorA11 ().

* DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, 
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
* You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass 
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
From an element node, you can access and update its 
content using properties such as textContent and 
innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
