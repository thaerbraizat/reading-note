# css
* **CSS** treats each HTML element as if it is in its 
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
* Containing Elements
* If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element.
* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute 
positioning*. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS.
* You can also float elements using the float property
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

* The *float property* moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts.
* CSS *frameworks*aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS 
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
