## Html
*HTML* elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page .
Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs
Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such 
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence.

## CSS
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule 
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements

## BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS 
You should write comments to explain what your code does. 
They help make your code easier to read and understand. 
This can help you and others who read your code. 

WHAT IS A VARIABLE?

**A script** will have to temporarily 
store the bits of information it 
needs to do its job. It can store this 
data in variables. JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values.
loops
1. Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 
2. Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands.
3. if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
4. There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do while.
