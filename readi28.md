2. Explain 3rd party cookies?

Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server's code.

3. How do pixel tags work?

A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. ... The tracking pixel URL is the memory location on the server. When the user visits a website, the image with the tag is loaded from this server.


* **Reducers**
the reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.

* **Redux was specifically designed to work well with React. React lets you describe your UI as a function of your state, and Redux contains state and updates it in response to actions.**
