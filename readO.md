1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.
This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

3. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

Data paragraphs,Sparklines ,Two-dimensional sentences

4. When are diversity efforts most successful?

when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

5. Why do diverse companies perform better?
 
 Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

 6. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa?

 YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
