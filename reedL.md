1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?

![q1](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashfaq-Shaikh-2/publication/328093939/figure/tbl2/AS:678268403470341@1538723197929/Comparison-between-SQL-and-NoSQL.png).

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

if your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

3. Give a real world example.?

store ,gym.

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema,Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns.
No complex queries, stored procedures, or views,High velocity transactions,
Large volume of data (in Terabyte range) requiring quick and cheap scalability.

5. Give a real world example.?

ad targeting platforms utilizing NoSQL include those from AOL, Mediamind and PayPal.

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?

First of all, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, it's just that they require little maintenance for it. All SQL based databases are very stable, and are in production since years.

7. What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

8. What is a relational database?

Database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports SQL . 

9. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

SQL structure, tables.

10. What is a ‘schema’?

Collection of database objects linked with a particular database username. The username that I am talking about is called the Schema owner, or more appropriately the owner of the related group of objects.

11. What is a NoSQL database?

Unstructured 

12. How does it work?

use collections instead of tables , collections have documents (can use different  structures / no schema applied).

13. What is inside of a Mongo database?

collections, documents , many different data that are not applied to schema or relations.

14. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible, because you store your data where ever you want, you don't have to follow a schema,(have less relations merging and super fast and efficient query ).

15. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Having duplicated data.
