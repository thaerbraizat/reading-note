1. Why is the Context API useful?

The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.

2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

you can use useContext hook

3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

Some sample use cases where the Context API proves helpful are: Theming — Pass down app theme. i18n — Pass down translation messages. Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user.
