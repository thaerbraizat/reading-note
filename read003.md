# HTML
* **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number.
* **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order).
* **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms

**dl tag**
The definition list is created with 
the *dl tag* element and usually 
consists of a series of terms and 
their definitions.
Inside the *dl tag* element you will 
usually see pairs of *dt tag* and 
*dd tag* elements.
*dt tag* This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition 
term) ,*dd tag*
This is used to contain the 
definition

# CSS
You can set several properties that affect the appearance of 
these boxes:
* Control the dimensions of your boxes.
* Create borders around boxes.
* Set margins and padding for boxes.
* Show and hide boxes.

 ### overflow 
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content 
contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have 
one of two values:
1. **Hidden**
This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in 
the box.
2. **Scroll**
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll 
to see the missing content.

### Display
Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
Border, Margin and Padding.
1. inline
This causes a block-level element to act like an inline element.
2. block
This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.
3. inline-block
This causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element, while retaining other 
features of a block-level element.
4. none
This hides an element from the page.

### Visibility
1. hidden
This hides the element.
2. visible
This shows the element.


**A switch** statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible 
value for this variable and the 
code that should run if the 
variable matches that value

Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands.

There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do while.
