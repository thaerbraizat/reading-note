You can specify any color in **CSS** in one of three ways:
1. *Rgb values*
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. 
For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. *Hex codes*
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. *Color names*
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan.

### Contrast
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is 
enough contrast for the text to be legible, It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast 
between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

### hsl
The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. 
The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside 
parentheses for:

1. *hue*
This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
2. *saturation* 
This is expressed as a percentage.
3. *lightness*
This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% 
being black.
