## Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, 
their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. 
As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## Html
The table>element is used 
to create a table. The contents 
of the table are written out row 
by row.
tr tag
You indicate the start of each 
row using the opening tr tag. 
(The tr stands for table row.) 
It is followed by one or more 
td elements (one for each cell 
in that row). 
At the end of the row you use a 
closing tr tag.
Each cell of a table is 
represented using a td
element. (The td stands for 
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a 
closing td tag.
For long tables you can split the table into a thead tag, 
tbody tag, and tfoot tag.

* The topmost object in the *Document Object Model* (or DOM) is the
