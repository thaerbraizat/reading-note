# JavaScript
* If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. 
At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code.
* Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction. 
* The console helps narrow down the area in which the 
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 

* BREAKPOINTS 
You can pause the execution of a script on any 
line using breakpoints. Then you can check the 
values stored in variables at that point in time. 
* HANDLING EXCEPTIONS
If you know your code might fail, use try, catch, and finally.Each one is given its own code block. 
## Debugging tips
* ANOTHER BROWSER 
Some problems are browserspecific. Try the code in another 
browser to see which ones are 
causing a problem. 
* ADD NUMBERS 
Write numbers to the console 
so you can see which the items 
get logged. It shows how far your 
code runs before errors stop it. 
* STRIP IT BACK 
Remove parts of code, and strip 
it down to the minimum you 
need. You can do this either by 
removing the code altogether, or 
by just commenting it out using 
multi-line comments: 
/* Anything between these 
characters is a cofllllent */ 
* EXPLAINING THE CODE 
Programmers often report 
finding a solution to a problem 
while explaining the code to 
someone else. 
* SEARCH 
Stack Overflow is a Q+A site for 
programmers. Or use a traditional search 
engine such as Google, Bing, or 
DuckDuckGo.
* VALIDATION TOOLS 
There are a number of on line 
validation tools that can help you 
try to find errors in your code: 
* *JAVASCRIPT* 
1. [www.jslint.com](http://www.jslint.com) 
2. [www.jshint.com](http://www.jshint.com)
* *JSON* 
[www.jsonlint.com](http://www.jsonlint.com) 
* *JQUERY* 
There is a jQuery debugger 
plugin available for Chrome 
which can be found in the 
Chrome web store.
