In any condition there is operator and two operands,An operand can be an *expression*.
operators usually return single value true or false, logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. 


Loops check a condition.if it returns **true**, a code block will run
then the condition will be checked again and if true the code block will run again
it repeats until the condition returns **false**.

### There are three common types of loops:
1. FOR (if you need to run aspecific number of times ).
2. while (if you do not know how many time the code should run).
3. DO While (same while loop but has one key difference:it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once ,even if the condition evaluates false).
