* Links are created using the *a *tag* . Users can click on anything 
between the opening *a tag* and the closing *a tag*. You specify 
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
* Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show 
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to 
work on a range of different sized screens.
* Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

* CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS 
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

### VARIABLE SCOPE 
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used 
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used 
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.

### HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORK 
Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them 
for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only 
remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.


# Pair Programming

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

**Why pair program?**
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
