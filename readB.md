![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/WVJVlckx4P6ovEXPdHJcOJTnvBfkCqN3cST4IvWUcgUhR9ixiqNgQJ84NAyGxJI0_4DhNtZXgku1_Bducs4Gk00SwEkrYz6inKtRYmcHgxN_Zm7MTxZ60lpcGyEZ)
1. What types of things can you pass in the props?
 React allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc.

 2. What is the big difference between props and state?
 In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component. The state can be initialized by props.

 3. When do we re-render our application?
 React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically. However, there may be cases where the render() method depends on some other data.
 4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
 anything you wanna store it inside the component like counter,track any thing inside your component .
