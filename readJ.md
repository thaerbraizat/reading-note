## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’?

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
 
In order to run a function multiple times after a fixed amount of time, we are using few functions. setInterval() Method: This method calls a function at specified intervals(in ms). This method will call continuously the function until clearInterval() is run, or the window is closed.

3. What does LIFO mean?

"LIFO" stands for last-in, first-out, meaning that the most recently produced items are recorded as sold first.

4. What causes a Stack Overflow?

The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

5. What is a ‘refrence error’?
 
 The ReferenceError object represents an error when a non-existent variable is referenced.

 6. What is a ‘syntax error’?

An exception caused by the incorrect use of a pre-defined syntax. Syntax errors are detected while compiling or parsing source code. For example, if you leave off a closing brace ( } ) when defining a JavaScript function, you trigger a syntax error.

7. What is a ‘range error’?

A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. This can be encountered when: passing a value that is not one of the allowed string values to String

8. What is a ‘type error’?

The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function

9. What is a breakpoint?

At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

10. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

A debugger is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development. Some debuggers will analyze a test run to see what lines of code were not executed.
