## Why Forms?
The best known form on the web is probably 
the search box that sits right in the middle of 
Google's homepage.
## How Forms Work?
1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button 
to submit the information to the server.
2.The name of each form 
control is sent to the 
server along with the 
value the user enters or 
selects.
3. The server processes 
the information using a 
programming language 
such as PHP, C#, VB.net, 
or Java. It may also store 
the information in a 
database
4. The server creates a new 
page to send back to the 
browser based on the 
information received
* A form may have several form controls, each 
gathering different information. The server 
needs to know which piece of inputted data 
corresponds with which form element.
# css
* There are several CSS properties that 
were created to work with specific types 
of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, 
and forms.
1. list-style-type
2. list-style-image
3. list-style-position
4. list-style
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.
* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more 
interactive.

* TERMINOLOGY 
*EVENTS FIRE OR ARE RAISED*
When an event has occurred, it is often described as having fired or 
been raised. In the diagram on the right, if the user is tapping on a link, a 
click event would fire in the browser. 
*EVENTS TRIGGER SCRIPTS*
Events are said to trigger a function or script. When the click event 
fires on the element in this diagram, it could trigger a script that enlarges 
the selected item. 
* EVENT LISTENERS 
Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events. 
They can deal with more than one function at a time 
but they are not supported in older browsers.
* USER INTERFACE EVENTS 
User interface CUI) events occur as a result of interaction with the 
browser window rather than the HTML page contained within it, 
e.g., a page having loaded or the browser window being resized. 
* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a 
JavaScript function. When this function then changes 
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because 
it has responded to the user.
