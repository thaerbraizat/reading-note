# html
## form
 forms its a way to take inputs from user and use it as a block with Information related to each other


1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button 
to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form 
control is sent to the 
server along with the 
value the user enters or 
selects.
 
* A form may have several form controls, each 
gathering different information. The server 
needs to know which piece of inputted data 
corresponds with which form element.
# css

* There are several CSS properties that 
were created to work with specific types 
of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, 
and forms.
1. list-style-type
2. list-style-image
3. list-style-position
4. list-style
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.
* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more 
interactive.

# javascript

* Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events. 
They can deal with more than one function at a time 
but they are not supported in older browsers.
* USER INTERFACE EVENTS 
User interface CUI  events occur as a result of interaction with the 
browser window rather than the HTML page contained within it, 
 a page having loaded or the browser window being resized. 

* Examples of events 
1. mouse events
2. keyborad events
3. HTML form events
4. User interface events
